# CS-340-Client-Server-Development
Class project to allow access to a database through basic UI implementation using Python and Mongodb

Question 1: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

**To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, we must use encapsulation, descriptive naming practices, comments, and generic parameters. By separating our logic into the AnimalShelter class and avoiding hardcoding values in our methods, we can make the class modular. We could use this CRUD Python module to filter and sort data through any MongoDB database fairly easily, with just a few parameter changes within the module.**

Question 2: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

**As a computer scientist, I approached the project with careful consideration towards the user's needs. Before I started, I reviewed the requirements documentation and developed my best interpretation of the user's needs. I did make a few mistakes in understanding the requirements, but those mistakes were small and easy to fix. The approach to this project was similar to that in previous classes. Review user requirements, design the implementation, execute, and test as we develop. In the future, I might create a cheat sheet for Linux shell and MongoDB commands until I memorize them better.**

Question 3: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

**Computer scientists are architects who design programs for specified users. They are tool makers and bridge the gap between people and computers, allowing users to do things with computers they might not be capable of doing. For example, in this project, we allowed a user to access a non-relational database with unstructured data and filter that information down to exactly what they needed with just a couple of clicks of a mouse. They can create programs that automate services that might take weeks to do down to minutes. This allows companies to innovate faster, more accurately, or even do things that were not possible before.**
